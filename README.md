# TBGLang
A ridiculous language, intended to be completely ridiculous and unusable. Please don't take this seriously. :P


## Rules

- This is meant to be ridiculous. Don't seriously try to learn this.
- Please keep it appropriate.
- The rules need to make some sense, "unicorn rainbow magic" isn't a letter. How much is up to you, however.
- Don't change these rules. @Tymewalk will restore them if you do.
 - Open issues if you want to suggest changes.
- Keep each part in its own file. i.e, alphabet.md, grammar.md, etc.
